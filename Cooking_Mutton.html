    <p>Heat oil and ghee in a pressure cooker and add in the Thalappakatti Biriyani Masala paste. <br>Add in the mutton
        to the pan. For biryani, always use mutton with bone. Bone has a lot of flavour.</br> </p>
    <p>Add in two cups of water and add in the salt.</p>
    <p>Add in the plain yogurt (curd) and red chilli powder.</P>
    <p>Mix well and cook the mutton in the masala for 20 minutes on a medium flame. Ignore the number of whistles in the
        cooker. Just cook for 20 minutes and remove the cooker from heat and wait for the pressure to settle.</p>
    <p>Open the cooker and see if the mutton pieces are cooked well. Cook for 2-3 whistles more if the meat is hard. Set
        aside.</p>
