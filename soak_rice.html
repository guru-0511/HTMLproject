            *Jeera Samba Rice also known as Jeeraga samba is a very aromatic rice. <br>The grain of the rice is very
            tiny
            and it gets its name for its resemblance to Cumin seeds, also called as Seeragam/Jeera in Tamil. <br>It has
            a
            very distinct taste, fluffs up well when cooked and south Indian biriyani''s are made with this rice.</p>
